To run this code you should edit the “build.gradle.kts” file for this project, which configures the build process, to add the CanvasLib dependency to the project dependencies. The file should look like this:

>     ... 
>     dependencies { 
>         testImplementation(kotlin("test")) 
>         implementation("io.github.palex65:CanvasLib-jvm:1.0.2") // Add this line 
>     }  
>     ... 

After editing the “build.gradle.kts” file you'll need to tell your IDE that the build process was updated selecting the update button on the upper right corner of the editing window.
